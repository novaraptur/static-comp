# Plants! Static Comp -- Turing 2103FE, M2

The Plants! Static Comp is a site built as a project for Mod 2 of Turing School's Front-End program. The goal of
this project was to create a static site, based off of a given comp, in order to practice responsive design, accessibility,
and any other technologies we needed to work on. I chose to practice setting up an Express server as an optional
extension, as can be seen in my `content-update` branch on GitHub, to gain a better understanding of NPM dependencies
and local servers.

### Installation

Fork this repository and clone down to your local machine. If viewing / working with the localhost version, use
```bash
npm install
```
to install ExpressJS as a dependency.

### Languages & Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- NodeJS & ExpressJS

### Future Extensions

- [] Replacing images with own pictures to standardize image sizes
- [] Making a functional MVP-- allow user to click on cards to view information about each type of plant
- [] Search functionality -- allow user to search by type of plant (low light, etc.) or name of plant
- [] User functionality-- allow users to sign in, save plants to "my plants" section, etc.
- [] More Node & Express practice
- [] More content-- add more plant cards for different varieties of plants
